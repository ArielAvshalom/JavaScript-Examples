## Type Coercion

JavaScript will automatically attempt to modify the type of a variable in certain circumstances. When speaking about Type Coercion, this modification is implicit (implicit changes can give a developer a really bad day!).

When the conversion is explicit, this is called type conversion.

<code>
const value1 = '5';
const value2 = 9;
let sum = value1 + value2;

console.log(sum);

</code>

What will be the output?
